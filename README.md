# self-projects
These are projects I do myself at my own leisure. Most projects here (as of Dec 2018) are for teaching myself to code.

Each .py file I finish will contain an accompanying .exe file creating using "pyinstaller -F name_of_file.py".

Current Projects uploaded:
  1. battleship_ai.py

          - "easy"/"cakewalk" randomly selects targets
          - "med"/"average" randomly selects targets until it hits a ship and then zeros in on rest of ship
          - "hard"/"methodical" randomly selects targets based on predefined pattern before comTurn() function
